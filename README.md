# Task-02: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle:
[Customer Segmentation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and perform necessary data cleaning.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the distribution of different features.
   - Analyze customer spending patterns.
   
3. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Normalize the data to ensure better clustering performance.
   
4. **K-Means Clustering:**
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method.
   - Apply K-means clustering to segment customers.
   
5. **Cluster Analysis & Visualization:**
   - Interpret the characteristics of each cluster.
   - Visualize clusters using scatter plots and other techniques.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the clustering process.

## Results
- The model segments customers into different groups based on their purchase behavior.
- Businesses can use these insights for targeted marketing and personalized customer services.
